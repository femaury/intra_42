# Privacy Policy for Intra 42

## Owner and Data Controller

Felix Maury built the Intra 42 app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Felix Maury at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

I do not collect any information about you. All information used for this Service is stored locally on your phone and will be permanently destroyed if you delete the application. The only information that is collected is by third party services (Fabric Crashlytics - see below) to ensure the service provided to you works as intended and improve it when possible.

## Information I collect and why

The Service uses OAuth2.0 to log you in 42's intranet through your personnal credentials, which the Service never has access to. All tokens used for API requests are stored locally on your device and never shared. You can remove all tokens from the app by logging out at any time.

## Third Party Services

In addition to the Service I provide directly, I also use third party service providers (collectively referred to as “Third Party Services”) who operate their own Privacy Policies. The Third Party Services I use are deemed important to the effective operation of my Service.

These services, in a case of an error in the app, collect data and information on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

### Third Party Services I use:

[**Fabric**](https://docs.fabric.io/apple/fabric/data-privacy.html) — for the capture and collection of crash logs to help me identify bugs in my Service.\
[**Apple Analytics**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202100) — (if enabled by user) for the collection of anonymous analytical data to help me better understand how users use my Service.

### Third Party API's (Application Programming Interface):

**42 API** — allows you to connect with 42's intranet in order to be provided the Service.

### Third-party links and content

My Service displays links which, when clicked, will redirect you to third-party websites. It also displays content obtained directly from [**42's**](https://42.fr) servers. These all have their own independent privacy policies, and I have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

My Service is not for use by children under 13 and is not built to attract anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If I learn that I have collected personal information of a child under 13, I will immediately delete such information.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

This Service complies with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. I therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used, if it is.

## Your Consent

By using my Service, you consent to this privacy policy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
